# Muse2014IntoVrchat
Some quick disclaimers before we get started:
I am not associated with Interaxon or the Muse corperation (whatever they go by these days).
Most of the software used alongside this project is abandonware, and it isn't guarenteed to work.

What you'll need:
Muse MU-01 (2 charging ports)
MuseIO 3.4.1 (can be found at https://github.com/DrBrainlove/muse_tools)
Bluetooth Adapter

1. Install the Windows Muse SDK
2. Follow the steps to get MuseIO up and running on port 1647
3. Open main.py
4. Set VRChat avatar params properly (or use TouchOSC to map them)
   Params are:
       /Focus (0-1)
       /FocusLeft (0-1)
       /FocusRight (0-1)
       /Blink (0,1)

Will write better docs when I get a minute. Thanks!
